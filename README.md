# HotkeyMuzzle ðŸ”‡

A Chrome extension that temporarily disables keyboard shortcuts with customizable controls. Perfect for preventing accidental keyboard shortcuts while gaming, testing, or when you need to temporarily mute browser hotkeys.

## What It Does

HotkeyMuzzle allows you to:
- **Temporarily disable keyboard shortcuts** in your browser with a single click
- **Whitelist essential shortcuts** (like Cmd+C, Cmd+V) so they continue working
- **Get visual feedback** when shortcuts are blocked or when the extension state changes
- **Customize which shortcuts to allow** through an easy-to-use options page

The extension blocks common browser shortcuts that use modifier keys (Cmd, Ctrl, Alt) while preserving normal typing functionality and whitelisted shortcuts.
